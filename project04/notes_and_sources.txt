-Just created the article class with scaffolding. I included
creation_date and edit_count because I know I'll have to print them
later. Now I need to remove them from the 'new' article form
since I want those to default to 0 and the current time when
the thing is submitted.

http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_date_time.htm
-Added
  after_initialize :default_values
 
  private
    def default_values
       self.edit_count ||= 0
       self.creation_date ||= Time.now.to_date()
     end
to article.rb to initialize defaults. it seems to work as soon as they
hit the button to 'create a new article'.

-Messing with the Articles form, noticed that I have attributes for 
string and date. I forgot that I shouldn't have any spaces when creating something with scaffolding "edit_count: int" vs "edit_count:int". I unfortunately had the space, so now I need to do some damage control.
     -I tried doing 'rails generate' again, but without the spaces. It           failed because I already had 'Articles'.
     -I'm going to destroy the scaffolding using 'rails destroy article'.
code used::
          rails destroy scaffold Article
          rails generate scaffold Article title:string author:string body:text creation_date:date edit_count:int
          rake db:migrate

http://www.orthogonalthought.com/blog/index.php/2007/06/mysql-and-ruby-on-rails-datatypes/
There was an error during the migrate, with using :int. I'm going to try using :integer instead after destroying / recreating the scaffold.

-Another error with rake db:migrate. It says that articles table already exists, which it should, so I can't recreate it. I'll need to just delete it and rake again.

using rake db:reset to keep things easy. Except, it didn't actually work. 

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html
I tried rolling back using  rake db:migrate:redo STEP=15 . But it didn't work.

I went into db/migration and changed the file to just have the drop, ran it, then ran with just the create table methods.
  def self.down
    drop_table "articles"
  end

  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :author
      t.text :body
      t.date :creation_date
      t.integer :edit_count

      t.timestamps
    end
  end

It worked!!!

Now, I can create an article.
I test after adding the initialization back for creation_date and edit_count, only to get the error

1 error(s) on assignment of multiparameter attributes

-Small things to check. None of them worked, unfortunately.

-Date formatting

I removed 

  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :creation_date %><br />
    <%= f.date_select :creation_date %>
  </div>
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :edit_count %><br />
    <%= f.number_field :edit_count %>
  </div>

from the _form, because it was causing the problem.(i don't actually want user input for the date anyways). Now it works fine.
